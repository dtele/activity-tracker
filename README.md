# **Activity Tracker**

This GUI-based program logs what a user does and the time they do it for 
while the program is running and saves it to a JSON file. This data can be 
read later and is grouped in two ways:

> process name: time spent using it (eg- `python.exe: 0:02:08`)

> window title: time spent using it (eg- `test â€“ README.md PyCharm: 0:06:20`)

I made this to boost my productivity by monitoring how much time I spend 
on unproductive things and minimizing them.

Made for a school project.

    - Run: `setup.py` 
    - Paste in a cmd shell: `python setup.py`/`python3 setup.py` or `pip install -r requirements.txt`
